# KeePassIk2
Updated version of the password manager.
In this version, I removed the unnecessary function associated with the key file, 
since it does not really carry a useful function. 
The system of working with an encrypted file has also been redesigned, 
now the decrypted data is stored in ram, and not in temporary files. 
A small optimization of accesses to the encrypted file has also been carried out. 
Now the databases are stored with the extension .nfr instead of .xlsm.
I am Russian, and I did the program for myself in the first place, 
and the localization of this program is still only in Russian.
